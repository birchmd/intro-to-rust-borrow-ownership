# Ownership and Borrowing in Rust

This repository is the companion of the workshop given by Michael Birch at the University of Waterloo on May 29, 2023. Though others stumbling across this later may also find it useful.

This repository contains some code examples of basic concepts in Rust's memory management.
The slides contained in `ownership-and-borrowing-in-rust.pdf` add some commentary to these code examples and show the order in which they should be looked at.
